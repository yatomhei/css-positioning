      <h3>Absolute Positioned</h3>
      <p>In the absolute positioning model, a box is explicitly offset with respect to <u>its containing block</u>. It does not sit within the normal flow of the page and will overlap any surrounding elements. Additionally, the original position of the div is not preserved, and other elements are able to occupy that space.</p>
      <p>Also, though absolutely positioned boxes have margins, they <u>do not</u> collapse with any other margins.</p>
      <p>An element is considered absolutely positioned if itâ€™s position property value is <b>absolute</b> or <b>fixed</b>.</p>
